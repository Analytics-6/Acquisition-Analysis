- Explored the huge dataset
- Created new columns to aid in analysis
- Filtered, sorted, aggregated the data to summarize and highlight important information
- Built plots to communicate key insights

### Findings
- Total discounts
- Percentage discounts

### Recommendation
- Change pricing strategy and offer less discounts for staple products. Increase discounts for products that have expiry dates coming up and are less bought
